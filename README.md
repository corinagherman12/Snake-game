Developed a 2D Snake game using Python and Pygame, incorporating dynamic gameplay with snake
movement and food collection mechanics.
Implemented a randomized map generation system that places obstacles and food in different locations
with each new playthrough, creating unique experiences and enhancing replayability. The map is
procedurally generated at the start of each session, keeping the gameplay fresh and challenging by
introducing varying levels of difficulty with random placements of obstacles and food.
